# gourmetFood

This is a mock project to showcase knowledge of Java Full Stack training. 

Uses Spring backend to interact with AWS RDS to handle data and send to front.

Front end is Angular framework that mimics a restaurant ordering system for a user at a table. 

Current staning of the project is adhering to project criteria and requested functionallity. 

I plan to continue to developing the project and add much more functionailty to improve how it works and looks.
